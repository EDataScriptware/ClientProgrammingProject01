**Here are the reasons why I should receive a B or more! !**

- I took an interesting approach of not having a div but manually creating <p> and <select> for each loop to create a next step. 

- a "." in the beginning of the directory and making it more obscure than it is. No one will expect to type in "." at the beginning of the directory.
-- "https://serenity.ist.rit.edu/~emr9018/340/" has a warning to people "randomly" crawling to my website.

- I sought out for assistance of having to roll through with an interesting approach but by the time for me to create a "roll back" by different selections became tougher and doing overwork. 
-- With assistance of Aaron "Joel" Parker, Aaron Kelly, and Vincent V. I could not get the roll back to function as part of programming requirements. 

- I was able to use the "data.js" as a "database". I have thought of creating a .sql database (that I've learned in Web and Mobile II under Prof. Jim Habermas) at a later point but I decided it would be too much work and would rather avoid compromising the entire scheme and framework that I've created.

- Once you click through, assumingly you do not change your mind, I have made the background screen along with border move down slowly as if it's a mobile device. 

- CSS background style matches with United States of America. 
-- Gradient background is beautiful. 
--- I duplicated United States of America photo for each location (New York City, New York) to show where the location and further creativity and design of this project. 

- Works are commented. 
-- While it is a "spaghetti code" in people's eyes, comments of works are left intentionally to show my greater efforts placed into this work.  

- I physically downloaded browsers to test website on. Everything besides IE, which redirects, (excluding Edge) works.

- No "arrows" or any decorations in select/option. It makes the design look ugly and basic. 

- A custom website was designed out of HTML and CSS with no javascript to show how barebone IE is. 
-- 4 logos of each different browsers indicates browser installation for updated version.
--- Naturally, you want the best experience for CLIENTS in PROGRAMMING style (*pun intended*). 

- JS animation was created for RV to keep moving around in a loop on United States of America header image map.

- Document.title is set in a way that is not too ugly.

- Validation Check of the textbox for name is included. It will send alert prompt whether you got it right or wrong.
-- If right, it will say "hey! [name]. . ." 
--- If wrong, "please try again"
